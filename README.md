# Machine Learning Model Interpretation

This repository provides a simple demonstration of how to interpret machine learning model predictions by generating permuted images and visualizing their impact on prediction using a heatmap.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python and a code editor installed.
2. Open your code editor and create a file named `perm_images.py`.
3. Download a sample image and place it in the same directory.
4. Run `python perm_images.py` to generate permuted images.
5. Create a file named `model_interpretation.py` and run it with `python model_interpretation.py` to generate a heatmap.
6. Create a file named `image_post_processing.py` and run it with `python image_post_processing.py` to highlight regions based on the heatmap.

## Conclusion

This simple demonstration helps you understand the significance of different image regions in machine learning model predictions.
